Citrus Data Visualization

Summary 
--------

Citrus is a program written in the Unity3D game engine which can be used to represent data visually. 
Once imported into the program, this data can be navigated in 3D. 

Departure from Iris
-----------

Citrus is an overhaul of the prototype iris.

Notable departures from the original program include: 

 - Implementation in C# instead of javascript
 - Unity's now deprecated GUI system will no longer be used. 
 - The side toolbar will be retired in exchange for a windowing system similar to most IDEs and 
   Unity itself. This was just not feasible with the old GUI framework.
